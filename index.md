# Welcome Frogger 3D
This game was created for our History of Computing Class at the University of Notre Dame. Our objective is to recreate a 2D game into a 3D game. We chose to implemet the classic game Frogger. This game encapsulates the 

## Meeting the Requirments 
We used Unity to build the scene and the code for the game. For the scenery we made cars, trucks, train, and water with logs all through Unity. Alos, we added in the physics to the vehicles and collison detection. We created a frog skeleton in Maya so we could animate it like an actual frog. This will give it the realistic view of a frog moving when a user moves around the course. We put in game play code that will time the user, keep track of score and lives and determine how a player loses a life based on the collison detection. For the user input device, they will use the key board to be able to navigate throughout the scene. This game can be run online through Windows and through MacOS. We also have the code that is stored to GitHub and can be downloaded with the links on the website. This game is built into the website and will run for you automatically when the user opens the link. There is no need to build the game from scratch each time. This website used on GitHub is used for our documentation of the project. 

## Design Implmentation 
Clay: Focused on the frog animation to allow the frog to move properly. Did this in Maya to build a skeleton for the frog and apply animation to the object. He also worked on the coding of the game and implmenting the frog into the scene so the game could run properly together. 

Alec: Worked on the scene adding in the cars, trucks, train, logs and scenery to the display. Implemented the code that allowed for collisions on the onjects and the physics on the objects so they could interact with the frog. He used Unity to make all of the objects in the scene. 

Chris: Worked on the code for the game play state that included how points are scored, how the frog can lose a life, and different levels into the game. Additioanlly, completed the documention throughout and genrated the website using GitHub and integrated the game online. 

## Accomplishments 
The team was able to accomplish a great deal since we were able to make a complete functioning game with a few different levels, an animated character and Unity objects with collison detection. The game implemented a realistic 3D view of the original game Frogger which was the main objective. Additionally, we were able to create a website that includes the game and properly documents our work. 

## What We Learned 
We gained a lot of experience in how to make objects in Unity and Unity in general. We learned how to add physics to objects and collision detection. Additionally, we learned how to animate and object and import it from Maya into Unity. Finally, we learned how t embed a Unity project into a website so it can be executed online and played by all!
